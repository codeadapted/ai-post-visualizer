### Important

Although installing and activating the plugin won't affect a normal website, Multisite Author Bio is meant to work on a Multisite network and, thus, does not benefit you unless you have multisite enabled.

Please keep in mind that the options added to the database are not removed on uninstall by default in order to preserve data. If you would like to clear all data added by the plugin you can go to the plugin's settings page and check `Clear translation data on uninstall`.

### For Developers

The data is stored in the main network's site database to limit the amount of data created by the plugin.
- `mab_clear_data` is stored in `wp_options` and determines whether the plugin's data should be removed on uninstall.
- `mab_profile_bio_[site_name]` is stored in `wp_usermeta` and is the author bio variant for `[site_name]`.

Multisite Author Bio uses the to `get_the_author_user_description` filter to update the author bio for each network site. If an author bio variation is not present for a specific site it will use the default author biographical information from the main network site.
